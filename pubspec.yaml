# usin packages: https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/using-packages

# install packages from pub.dev - the official package repository for Dart and FLutter apps
# can do it from the command line:
# dart pub add http
# dart pub add build_runner --dev
# or in VSCode: Ctrl + Shift + P, then "Dart: Add Dependency", then enter a comma separated list of packcages
# how to choose which packages to install: 1) is it listed as a flutter favourite 2) does it have a high pub score 3) is it well maintained on GitHub 4) is it well documented?
# when you install a package, you depend on it, and depending on packages taht are buggy, not maintained, and poorly documented will likely end poorly 

# flutter_lints package installed by default
# lints are rules taht are used to encourage good coding practices, and help you write better and safer code
# flutter_lints is the default linter package - but as you progress you can switch for stricter linting rules
# enabling linter rules is one of the best things you can do when startin a new Flutter projects
